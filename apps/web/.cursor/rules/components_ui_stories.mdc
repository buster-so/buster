- All new stories title with "UI/directory/{componentName}" unless specified otherwise.
- Instead of console log for click events, you should do native storybook actions
- If a new story is made in the controller directory, I would like it title "Controllers/{controller name or parent controller name}/{componentName}"
- If a new story is found in the features directory, I would like it titled "Features/{featureName or parent feature name}/{componentName}"
- onClick events (or similar) should be mocked with fn() from the storybook test package
- If I ever need to mock an endpoint you should use msw. Use MSW for mocking api calls. All endpoints should be appended with the BASE_URL For example:         http.get(`BASE_URL`, () => {}). The BASE_URL is found in [config.ts](mdc:src/api/buster_rest/config.ts)
