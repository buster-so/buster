# Component Name

## Parent Project

This is a sub-PRD of the [Project Name](project_name.md) project. Please refer to the parent PRD for the overall project context, goals, and implementation plan.

## Problem Statement

<!-- 
Clearly articulate the specific problem this component solves within the larger project. Include:
- Current state and behavior
- Expected behavior
- How this fits into the larger project
- Specific pain points this component addresses
- Why this component is necessary
-->

Current behavior:
- [Current behavior 1]
- [Current behavior 2]
- [Current behavior 3]

Expected behavior:
- [Expected behavior 1]
- [Expected behavior 2]
- [Expected behavior 3]

## Goals

<!-- List specific, measurable goals this component will achieve -->
1. 
2. 
3. 

## Non-Goals

<!-- List what is explicitly out of scope -->
1. 
2. 
3. 

## Implementation Plan

<!-- 
Break down the implementation into phases. Each phase should:
- Be independently deployable
- Include its own technical design
- Have clear success criteria
- Include comprehensive tests
-->

### Phase 1: [Name] ‚è≥ (In Progress)

#### Technical Design
<!-- Include technical details specific to this phase -->

```rust
// Include actual code structures/types
struct ComponentName {
    field1: Type1,    // Purpose of field1
    field2: Type2,    // Purpose of field2
}
```

#### Implementation Steps
1. [ ] Step 1
   - Technical details
   - Edge cases to handle
   - Testing requirements

2. [ ] Step 2
   - Technical details
   - Edge cases to handle
   - Testing requirements

#### Tests

##### Unit Tests
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn test_normal_case() {
        // Test implementation
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_edge_case_1() {
        // Test implementation
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_error_case_1() {
        // Test implementation
    }
}
```

##### Integration Tests
- Test Scenario: [Description]
  - Setup:
    - Required data
    - System state
  - Steps:
    1. Action 1
    2. Action 2
  - Assertions:
    - Expected state
    - Error cases
  - Edge Cases:
    - Case 1
    - Case 2

#### Success Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] All tests passing

### Phase 2: [Name] üîú (Not Started)

[Similar structure to Phase 1]

   - Interface changes:
   - Testing requirements:
   - Integration points:

## Security Considerations

<!-- List security implications and how they're addressed -->
- Consideration 1
  - Risk:
  - Mitigation:
  - Testing:
