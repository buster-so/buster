        "message": "Let me start by thinking through the TODO items to understand what's needed to identify our top customer.\n\n1. **Determine how a \"customer\" is identified in the data**\n   Looking at the available documentation, I can see there's a `customer` model that represents Adventure Works customers (individual or store accounts). The customer model has a `customerid` as the primary key and includes core identifiers like `personid` for individual customers and `storeid` for store accounts. This model also has behavioral segments and filters. The customer can be joined to sales orders via `sales_order_header` using the `customerid` field.\n\n2. **Determine metric for \"top customer\"**\n   For determining the \"top\" customer, I need to consider what metric to use. Looking at the available models, I can see there's a `customer_all_time_clv` model that provides \"All-time customer lifetime value per customer\" which sums all SalesOrderDetail line totals across a customer's entire order history. This seems like the most appropriate metric to determine the \"top\" customer - the one who has generated the most total revenue. The metric is called `metric_clv_all_time` and represents the total revenue attributable to each customer.\n\n3. **Determine the visualization type and axes**\n   Since the user is asking \"who is our top customer\" (singular), this indicates they want to identify a single customer rather than a list of top customers. According to the visualization guidelines, singular requests indicate a single item and should use a number card. The number card should display the customer's name and their CLV value (e.g., \"Top Customer: Customer Name - $X,XXX\").\n\n4. **Determine if the user is asking for a single metric, a report, or a dashboard**\n   The user is asking for a single piece of information - who is the top customer. This is a straightforward request for a single metric showing the top customer by lifetime value, not a comprehensive analysis requiring multiple visualizations or a dashboard.\n\nNow that I've considered the TODO items, I need to determine if further reasoning or validation is needed. I have good confidence in my approach using the customer_all_time_clv model to identify the top customer by lifetime value. However, I should validate that this model contains the data I expect and understand how to get the customer name for display.\n\nBased on that assessment, I need to continue with additional thoughts to validate my approach and test the SQL query that will be used for the visualization. I should use executeSql to confirm the data structure and test my query to identify the top customer.\n\nNext: Validate the customer_all_time_clv model structure and test a query to identify the top customer with their name and CLV value.",

The metric is called `metric_clv_all_time` and represents the total revenue attributable to each customer.\n\n3. **Determine the visualization type and axes**\n   Since the user is asking \"who is our top customer\" (singular), this indicates they want to identify a single customer rather than a list of top customers. According to the visualization guidelines, singular requests indicate a single item and should use a number card. The number card should display the customer's name and their CLV value (e.g., \"Top Customer: Customer Name - $X,XXX\").\n\n4. **Determine if the user is asking for a single metric, a report, or a dashboard**\n   The user is asking for a single piece of information - who is the top customer. This is a straightforward request for a single metric showing the top customer by lifetime value, not a comprehensive analysis requiring multiple visualizations or a dashboard.\n\nNow that I've considered the TODO items, I need to determine if further reasoning or validation is needed. I have good confidence in my approach using the customer_all_time_clv model to identify the top customer by lifetime value. However, I should validate that this model contains the data I expect and understand how to get the customer name for display.\n\nBased on that assessment, I need to continue with additional thoughts to validate my approach and test the SQL query that will be used for the visualization. I should use executeSql to confirm the data structure and test my query to identify the top customer.\n\nNext: Validate the customer_all_time_clv model structure and test a query to identify the top customer with their name and CLV value.",

Customers can be individuals (linked via `personid` to the `person` table) or stores (linked via `storeid`).\n\n2. **Determine metric for \"top customer\"** - ✅ RESOLVED  \n   I'm using the `customer_all_time_clv` model which provides `metric_clv_all_time` - the total lifetime value representing all revenue attributable to each customer. This is the most appropriate metric to determine the \"top\" customer.\n\n3. **Determine the visualization type and axes** - ✅ RESOLVED\n   Since the user asked \"who is our top customer\" (singular), this calls for a number card showing the single top customer. The number card will display: \"Top Customer: Roger Harui - $877,107.19\"\n\n4. **Determine if the user is asking for a single metric, a report, or a dashboard** - ✅ RESOLVED\n   This is a request for a single metric - identifying the top customer by lifetime value.\n\n**Final SQL Query Tested and Validated:**\n```sql\nSELECT \n    clv.customerid, \n    clv.metric_clv_all_time, \n    CASE \n        WHEN p.firstname IS NOT NULL THEN p.firstname || ' ' || p.lastname \n        ELSE 'Customer ' || clv.customerid::text \n    END AS customer_name\nFROM postgres.ont_ont.customer_all_time_clv clv\nLEFT JOIN postgres.ont_ont.customer cust ON clv.customerid = cust.customerid\nLEFT JOIN postgres.ont_ont.person p ON cust.personid = p.businessentityid\nORDER BY clv.metric_clv_all_time DESC\nLIMIT 1\n```\n\nThis query successfully identifies Roger Harui as our top customer with a lifetime value of $877,107.19.

The model has a primary key `customerid` and includes core identifiers. The description states it's used for customer-level analysis and has one row per customer. This seems like the most appropriate source for counting customers. I'm confident this is the right approach since the customer model is specifically designed for customer analysis.\n\n2. **Determine the visualization type and axes**\n   Since the user is asking \"how many customers do we have\" - this is asking for a single count value. Based on the visualization guidelines, this should be a number card since it's displaying a single key metric. The number card should show the total count of customers.\n\n3. **Determine if the user is asking for a single metric, a report, or a dashboard**\n   The user is asking a simple question about a single metric - the total number of customers. This is clearly a request for a single metric, not a comprehensive report or dashboard. They're using singular language and asking for one specific piece of information.\n\nNow that I've considered the TODO items, I need to determine if further reasoning or validation is needed. I should use the `executeSql` tool to validate that the customer table exists and get the actual count to ensure my approach is correct. I also want to understand the data structure better and confirm there are no issues with the count.\n\nBased on that assessment, I need to continue with additional prep work.

They want to know \"how many customers do we have\" which is a straightforward count question.\n\n1. **Determine how a \"customer\" is identified**\n   Looking at the available documentation, I can see there's a `customer` model that represents Adventure Works customers (individual or store accounts). The model has a primary key `customerid` and includes core identifiers. The description states it's used for customer-level analysis and has one row per customer. This seems like the most appropriate source for counting customers. I'm confident this is the right approach since the customer model is specifically designed for customer analysis.\n\n2. **Determine the visualization type and axes**\n   Since the user is asking \"how many customers do we have\" - this is asking for a single count value. Based on the visualization guidelines, this should be a number card since it's displaying a single key metric. The number card should show the total count of customers.\n\n3. **Determine if the user is asking for a single metric, a report, or a dashboard**\n   The user is asking a simple question about a single metric - the total number of customers. This is clearly a request for a single metric, not a comprehensive report or dashboard. They're using singular language and asking for one specific piece of information.\n\nNow that I've considered the TODO items, I need to determine if further reasoning or validation is needed. I should use the `executeSql` tool to validate that the customer table exists and get the actual count to ensure my approach is correct. I also want to understand the data structure better and confirm there are no issues with the count.\n\nBased on that assessment, I need to continue with additional prep work.

        "message": "Let me start by thinking through the TODO items to understand what the user is asking for and how to approach this analysis.\n\n**1. Determine how a \"customer\" is identified**\nBased on the documentation, I can see there's a `customer` model with a `customerid` as the primary key. This model includes attributes like `personid`, `storeid`, and `territoryid`. Customers can be either individuals (when personid is populated) or store accounts (when storeid is populated). For this analysis, I'll use `customerid` as the unique identifier for customers.\n\n**2. Determine metric for \"top customer\"**\nThe user asks for \"top customer\" which typically means the customer with the highest value. Looking at the available models, I can see:\n- `customer_all_time_clv` - provides all-time customer lifetime value per customer\n- `sales_order_header` - contains order-level data that can be aggregated by customer\n- `sales_order_detail` - contains line-level revenue data\n\nThe most straightforward approach is to use total revenue (CLV) to identify the top customer. I can use the `customer_all_time_clv` model which has `metric_clv_all_time` that sums all sales order detail line totals for each customer.\n\n**3. Determine how \"purchases\" are identified**\nPurchases are represented in the `sales_order_detail` table, which contains line items for each order. Each line has a `productid`, `orderqty`, and `linetotal`. To identify what products a customer purchases, I'll need to join from customer → sales_order_header → sales_order_detail → product.\n\n**4. Determine how to identify \"frequent purchases\"**\n\"Frequent purchases\" could mean:\n- Products purchased most often (by count of orders containing the product)\n- Products with highest total quantity purchased\n- Products with highest total revenue\n\nI'll interpret this as products that appear most frequently in the customer's orders (count of distinct orders containing each product), as this aligns with \"frequent\" purchases.\n\n**5. Determine how to group purchases to identify the most frequent ones**\nI'll group by product (using product name for readability) and count the number of distinct orders that contain each product for the top customer. This will show which products they buy most frequently.\n\n**6. Determine the visualization type and axes for showing the top customer**\nFor showing the top customer, I'll use a number card (metric visualization) that displays:\n- The customer's name (if available via person model)\n- Their total lifetime value\n\n**7. Determine the visualization type and axes for showing their most frequent purchases**\nFor showing the most frequent purchases, I'll use a horizontal bar chart:\n- X-axis: product_name (the products)\n- Y-axis: order_count (number of orders containing each product)\nThis will make it easy to see which products the customer purchases most frequently.\n\n**8. Determine if the user is asking for a simple report, more in-depth report, or a dashboard**\nThe user specifically asked for \"a report\" describing their top customer and their purchases. This is a simple, direct request that can be answered with:\n1. A number card showing the top customer and their CLV\n2. A bar chart showing their most frequent purchases\n3. Brief narrative explaining the findings\n\nThis is a simple report with two visualizations.\n\n**Determining Further Needs**\nI need to validate several assumptions:\n1. I should verify that the `customer_all_time_clv` model exists and contains the data I need\n2. I need to test the SQL to identify the top customer by CLV\n3. I need to test the SQL to get the most frequent purchases for that specific customer\n4. I should check if customer names are available (via the person model) or if I'll need to use customer IDs\n5. I need to confirm the join path from customer → orders → order details → products works as expected\n\n**Outlining Remaining Prep Work**\nNext steps:\n1. Query the `customer_all_time_clv` model to identify the top customer and verify data structure\n2. Query to get customer name information (via person model if it's an individual customer)\n3. Query to get the most frequent products for the top customer\n4. Validate the SQL queries that will be used in the final visualizations\n5. Plan the report structure with the two visualizations and narrative",

This pattern suggests Roger operates as a bike retailer maintaining inventory across various size options to serve different customer needs. The consistent ordering of **HL Mountain Frames** and **ML/HL Mountain Handlebars** (appearing in 6-8 orders) indicates ongoing component purchases, likely for bike assembly, repairs, or customization services.\n\nThe purchase frequency demonstrates a reliable, repeat-buying pattern with the same core products appearing across multiple orders, making Roger a highly predictable and valuable customer for inventory planning and relationship management.\n\n## Methodology\n\nThis analysis identified the top customer using the `customer_all_time_clv.metric_clv_all_time` field, which represents the sum of all `sales_order_detail.linetotal` values across the customer's entire order history. Customer identity was enriched by joining to the `person` table via `customer.personid` to obtain the customer's name.\n\nPurchase frequency was calculated by counting distinct `sales_order_header.salesorderid` values for each product purchased by the top customer. This metric represents how many separate orders contained each product, providing insight into which items the customer purchases most consistently over time. Products were identified by joining `sales_order_detail` to `product` on `productid`."

              "thought": "Let me start by thinking through the TODO items to understand what the user is asking for and how to approach this analysis.\n\n**1. Determine how a \"customer\" is identified**\nBased on the documentation, I can see there's a `customer` model with a `customerid` as the primary key. This model includes attributes like `personid`, `storeid`, and `territoryid`. Customers can be either individuals (when personid is populated) or store accounts (when storeid is populated). For this analysis, I'll use `customerid` as the unique identifier for customers.\n\n**2. Determine metric for \"top customer\"**\nThe user asks for \"top customer\" which typically means the customer with the highest value. Looking at the available models, I can see:\n- `customer_all_time_clv` - provides all-time customer lifetime value per customer\n- `sales_order_header` - contains order-level data that can be aggregated by customer\n- `sales_order_detail` - contains line-level revenue data\n\nThe most straightforward approach is to use total revenue (CLV) to identify the top customer. I can use the `customer_all_time_clv` model which has `metric_clv_all_time` that sums all sales order detail line totals for each customer.\n\n**3. Determine how \"purchases\" are identified**\nPurchases are represented in the `sales_order_detail` table, which contains line items for each order. Each line has a `productid`, `orderqty`, and `linetotal`. To identify what products a customer purchases, I'll need to join from customer → sales_order_header → sales_order_detail → product.\n\n**4. Determine how to identify \"frequent purchases\"**\n\"Frequent purchases\" could mean:\n- Products purchased most often (by count of orders containing the product)\n- Products with highest total quantity purchased\n- Products with highest total revenue\n\nI'll interpret this as products that appear most frequently in the customer's orders (count of distinct orders containing each product), as this aligns with \"frequent\" purchases.\n\n**5. Determine how to group purchases to identify the most frequent ones**\nI'll group by product (using product name for readability) and count the number of distinct orders that contain each product for the top customer. This will show which products they buy most frequently.\n\n**6. Determine the visualization type and axes for showing the top customer**\nFor showing the top customer, I'll use a number card (metric visualization) that displays:\n- The customer's name (if available via person model)\n- Their total lifetime value\n\n**7. Determine the visualization type and axes for showing their most frequent purchases**\nFor showing the most frequent purchases, I'll use a horizontal bar chart:\n- X-axis: product_name (the products)\n- Y-axis: order_count (number of orders containing each product)\nThis will make it easy to see which products the customer purchases most frequently.\n\n**8. Determine if the user is asking for a simple report, more in-depth report, or a dashboard**\nThe user specifically asked for \"a report\" describing their top customer and their purchases. This is a simple, direct request that can be answered with:\n1. A number card showing the top customer and their CLV\n2. A bar chart showing their most frequent purchases\n3. Brief narrative explaining the findings\n\nThis is a simple report with two visualizations.\n\n**Determining Further Needs**\nI need to validate several assumptions:\n1. I should verify that the `customer_all_time_clv` model exists and contains the data I need\n2. I need to test the SQL to identify the top customer by CLV\n3. I need to test the SQL to get the most frequent purchases for that specific customer\n4. I should check if customer names are available (via the person model) or if I'll need to use customer IDs\n5. I need to confirm the join path from customer → orders → order details → products works as expected\n\n**Outlining Remaining Prep Work**\nNext steps:\n1. Query the `customer_all_time_clv` model to identify the top customer and verify data structure\n2. Query to get customer name information (via person model if it's an individual customer)\n3. Query to get the most frequent products for the top customer\n4. Validate the SQL queries that will be used in the final visualizations\n5. Plan the report structure with the two visualizations and narrative",

This pattern suggests Roger operates as a bike retailer maintaining inventory across various size options to serve different customer needs. The consistent ordering of **HL Mountain Frames** and **ML/HL Mountain Handlebars** (appearing in 6-8 orders) indicates ongoing component purchases, likely for bike assembly, repairs, or customization services.\n\nThe purchase frequency demonstrates a reliable, repeat-buying pattern with the same core products appearing across multiple orders, making Roger a highly predictable and valuable customer for inventory planning and relationship management.\n\n## Methodology\n\nThis analysis identified the top customer using the `customer_all_time_clv.metric_clv_all_time` field, which represents the sum of all `sales_order_detail.linetotal` values across the customer's entire order history. Customer identity was enriched by joining to the `person` table via `customer.personid` to obtain the customer's name.\n\nPurchase frequency was calculated by counting distinct `sales_order_header.salesorderid` values for each product purchased by the top customer. This metric represents how many separate orders contained each product, providing insight into which items the customer purchases most consistently over time. Products were identified by joining `sales_order_detail` to `product` on `productid`."

Determine how each KPI metric is identified and calculated**\nLooking at the available precomputed metrics, I can see several relevant ones:\n- `total_sales_revenue` - already exists, calculates SUM(line total) by time periods\n- `number_of_orders` - already exists, counts distinct orders by time periods\n- `average_order_value` - already exists, calculates average order value by time periods\n- `order_fulfillment_rate` - already exists, percentage of orders shipped on time\n- `customer_retention_rate` - already exists, percentage of repeat customers\n\nFor other KPIs like total customers or gross profit, I may need to build custom metrics. Let me check what's available:\n- Customer count: I can count distinct customers from sales_order_header\n- Gross Profit: I can use product_gross_profit or calculate from revenue - cost\n\n**3. Determine the time frame for the KPI metrics**\nSince the user didn't specify, I should default to \"Last 12 Months\" as per the guidelines. This provides a meaningful recent window for KPI tracking.\n\n**4. Determine the visualization type and axes for each KPI metric**\nFor KPI metrics on a dashboard, the best visualization type is typically \"metric\" (number cards) since they show single aggregate values. Each KPI will be a number card showing the current value for the time period.\n\n**5. Determine if any groupings or filters should be applied to the KPI metrics**\nFor a high-level KPI dashboard, I won't apply specific groupings or filters beyond the time frame. The metrics should show overall business performance.\n\n**Determining Further Needs:**\nI have good clarity on the approach. I should use existing precomputed metrics where available (following best practices), and I can see several that match common KPIs. However, I need to validate:\n1. Whether I need to query the data to understand current values or if I can proceed directly\n2. If there are any specific calculations I need to test\n\nSince I'm using precomputed metrics primarily, and the user's request is straightforward, I believe I can proceed to create the metrics. However, let me think about which specific KPIs to include:\n\nCore KPIs I'll include:\n1. Total Sales Revenue (last 12 months)\n2. Total Orders (last 12 months) \n3. Average Order Value (last 12 months)\n4. Total Customers (distinct count, last 12 months)\n5. Gross Profit Margin (last 12 months average)\n6. Order Fulfillment Rate (last 12 months)\n\nThese 6 KPIs provide a balanced view of financial performance, operational efficiency, and customer metrics.\n\n**Outlining Remaining Prep Work or Conclude Prep Work If Finished:**\nI have sufficient information to proceed. I'll use precomputed metrics where available and create simple aggregation metrics for the others. The SQL will be straightforward - filtering to the last 12 months and aggregating the appropriate measures. I'm ready to move to asset creation.",

According to the dashboard rules:\n- Each row must sum to 12 column units\n- Each metric requires at least 3 units\n- Maximum of 3 metrics per row (4 is too cramped)\n- I should use the YML array syntax with `-` not `[]` formatting\n\nFor 4 metrics, I have a few layout options:\n- Option 1: Two rows with 2 metrics each (6, 6 per row)\n- Option 2: First row with 1 metric (12), second row with 3 metrics (4, 4, 4)\n- Option 3: First row with 3 metrics (4, 4, 4), second row with 1 metric (12)\n\nGiven that these are all number cards showing key inventory metrics, I think Option 1 makes the most sense - two rows with 2 metrics each, giving each metric equal prominence with 6 column units each.\n\nRow 1: Total Current Inventory, Total Incoming Inventory\nRow 2: Total Outgoing Inventory, Inventory Shipped Last 30 Days\n\nThis layout provides a logical flow:\n- Row 1: Current state (what we have now, what's coming)\n- Row 2: Outbound activity (what's pending to go out, what went out recently)\n\nI have all the information needed to create the dashboard.

According to the dashboard rules:\n- Each row must sum to 12 column units\n- Each metric requires at least 3 units\n- Maximum of 3 metrics per row (4 is too cramped)\n- I should use the YML array syntax with `-` not `[]` formatting\n\nFor 4 metrics, I have a few layout options:\n- Option 1: Two rows with 2 metrics each (6, 6 per row)\n- Option 2: First row with 1 metric (12), second row with 3 metrics (4, 4, 4)\n- Option 3: First row with 3 metrics (4, 4, 4), second row with 1 metric (12)\n\nGiven that these are all number cards showing key inventory metrics, I think Option 1 makes the most sense - two rows with 2 metrics each, giving each metric equal prominence with 6 column units each.\n\nRow 1: Total Current Inventory, Total Incoming Inventory\nRow 2: Total Outgoing Inventory, Inventory Shipped Last 30 Days\n\nThis layout provides a logical flow:\n- Row 1: Current state (what we have now, what's coming)\n- Row 2: Outbound activity (what's pending to go out, what went out recently)\n\nI have all the information needed to create the dashboard.

This will give us the total current inventory across all products and locations. The quantity is measured in item units (not monetary).\n\n3. **Determine the visualization type and axes**\n   Since the user is asking \"how much\" inventory they have, this is a simple aggregation question asking for a single total value. According to the visualization guidelines, for single values or key metrics, I should prefer number cards over charts for clarity and simplicity. This would be a metric/number card showing the total inventory quantity.\n\n4. **Determine if the user is asking for a simple report, more in-depth report, or a dashboard**\n   The user's question is very straightforward - \"How much current inventory do I have?\" This is a simple, direct request for a specific metric without any \"why\" or \"how\" questions requiring investigation. According to the request classification guidelines, this is a Simple/Direct Request (Standard Analysis). The user is asking for a single well-defined metric. Since this is a simple request with a single value, I should create a simple report with a single number card visualization and brief narrative explaining the result.\n\nNow let me determine if I need further investigation. The documentation is clear about where inventory data lives (product_inventory model) and what field to use (quantity). I don't need to validate any assumptions with SQL queries since the data structure is well-documented and straightforward. The user is asking for a total, which is a simple SUM aggregation.\n\nI have all the information I need to proceed to asset creation. I'll create:\n- A metric showing total current inventory as a number card\n- A simple report containing this metric with a brief explanation\n\nNo further prep work is needed.",

This will give us the total current inventory across all products and locations. The quantity is measured in item units (not monetary).\n\n3. **Determine the visualization type and axes**\n   Since the user is asking \"how much\" inventory they have, this is a simple aggregation question asking for a single total value. According to the visualization guidelines, for single values or key metrics, I should prefer number cards over charts for clarity and simplicity. This would be a metric/number card showing the total inventory quantity.\n\n4. **Determine if the user is asking for a simple report, more in-depth report, or a dashboard**\n   The user's question is very straightforward - \"How much current inventory do I have?\" This is a simple, direct request for a specific metric without any \"why\" or \"how\" questions requiring investigation. According to the request classification guidelines, this is a Simple/Direct Request (Standard Analysis). The user is asking for a single well-defined metric. Since this is a simple request with a single value, I should create a simple report with a single number card visualization and brief narrative explaining the result.\n\nNow let me determine if I need further investigation. The documentation is clear about where inventory data lives (product_inventory model) and what field to use (quantity). I don't need to validate any assumptions with SQL queries since the data structure is well-documented and straightforward. The user is asking for a total, which is a simple SUM aggregation.\n\nI have all the information I need to proceed to asset creation. I'll create:\n- A metric showing total current inventory as a number card\n- A simple report containing this metric with a brief explanation\n\nNo further prep work is needed.",

Looking at the documentation, I can see:\n   - The `purchase_order_detail` model has line-item details for purchase orders, including `orderqty` (quantity ordered) and `receivedqty` (quantity received)\n   - The `product_vendor` model has an `onorderqty` field described as \"Current quantity on open purchase orders for this product with this vendor\"\n   \n   The most direct way to measure incoming inventory would be to look at purchase orders where the ordered quantity exceeds the received quantity (orderqty - receivedqty > 0), or to use the `onorderqty` from product_vendor. Let me think about which is better:\n   - `purchase_order_detail`: This would give us the actual outstanding quantity on specific purchase orders (orderqty - receivedqty)\n   - `product_vendor.onorderqty`: This is described as \"current quantity on open purchase orders\" but is often null when nothing is on order\n   \n   The purchase_order_detail approach seems more reliable and direct. I should calculate the difference between orderqty and receivedqty to get the incoming/outstanding quantity.\n\n2. **Determine the metric for measuring incoming inventory**\n   The metric should be SUM(orderqty - receivedqty) from purchase_order_detail where orderqty > receivedqty.

              "thought": "Let me start by thinking through the TODO items to understand what the user is asking for.\n\n1. **Determine how \"incoming inventory\" is identified in the data**\n   \"Incoming inventory\" typically refers to inventory that has been ordered from vendors but not yet received. Looking at the documentation, I can see:\n   - The `purchase_order_detail` model has line-item details for purchase orders, including `orderqty` (quantity ordered) and `receivedqty` (quantity received)\n   - The `product_vendor` model has an `onorderqty` field described as \"Current quantity on open purchase orders for this product with this vendor\"\n   \n   The most direct way to measure incoming inventory would be to look at purchase orders where the ordered quantity exceeds the received quantity (orderqty - receivedqty > 0), or to use the `onorderqty` from product_vendor. Let me think about which is better:\n   - `purchase_order_detail`: This would give us the actual outstanding quantity on specific purchase orders (orderqty - receivedqty)\n   - `product_vendor.onorderqty`: This is described as \"current quantity on open purchase orders\" but is often null when nothing is on order\n   \n   The purchase_order_detail approach seems more reliable and direct. I should calculate the difference between orderqty and receivedqty to get the incoming/outstanding quantity.\n\n2. **Determine the metric for measuring incoming inventory**\n   The metric should be SUM(orderqty - receivedqty) from purchase_order_detail where orderqty > receivedqty. This will give us the total quantity of items that have been ordered but not yet received.\n\n3. **Determine the visualization type and axes**\n   Since the user is asking \"how much\" incoming inventory they have, this is asking for a single total value. According to the visualization guidelines, for single values or key metrics, I should prefer number cards. This would be a metric/number card showing the total incoming inventory quantity.\n\n4. **Determine if the user is asking for a simple report, more in-depth report, or a dashboard**\n   This is a simple, direct request similar to the previous question about current inventory. It's a Simple/Direct Request asking for a specific, well-defined metric. I should create a simple report with a single number card visualization and brief narrative.\n\nNow let me determine if I need further investigation. I should validate my assumption about how to calculate incoming inventory by checking the purchase_order_detail data to ensure my logic is correct.",

        "message": "Let me start by thinking through the TODO items to understand what the user is asking for.\n\n1. **Determine how \"outgoing inventory\" is identified in the data**\n   \"Outgoing inventory\" typically refers to inventory that has been sold/ordered by customers but not yet shipped or fulfilled. Looking at the documentation, I can see:\n   - The `sales_order_header` model has order-level information including `status` field\n   - The `sales_order_detail` model has line-item details for sales orders including `orderqty`\n   - The status field in sales_order_header has codes: 1 In Process, 2 Approved, 3 Backordered, 4 Rejected, 5 Shipped, 6 Cancelled\n   - The documentation notes that the current dataset contains status 5 (Shipped)\n   \n   For \"outgoing inventory,\" I need to identify orders that have been placed but not yet shipped. However, the documentation indicates that the current dataset only contains shipped orders (status = 5). This is a potential issue - if all orders in the system are already shipped, there may be no \"outgoing\" inventory in the traditional sense.\n   \n   Let me think about alternative interpretations:\n   - Orders that are \"In Process\" (status 1), \"Approved\" (status 2), or \"Backordered\" (status 3) would represent outgoing inventory\n   - But the documentation says the dataset contains status 5 (Shipped)\n   \n   I need to validate what statuses actually exist in the data to understand if there are any unshipped orders.\n\n2. **Determine the metric for measuring outgoing inventory**\n   If unshipped orders exist, the metric would be SUM(orderqty) from sales_order_detail joined to sales_order_header where status < 5 (not shipped or cancelled). But I need to verify what data actually exists.\n\n3. **Determine the visualization type and axes**\n   This would be a number card showing the total outgoing inventory quantity, similar to the previous two requests.\n\n4. **Determine if the user is asking for a simple report, more in-depth report, or a dashboard**\n   This is a simple, direct request for a specific metric - a Simple/Direct Request.\n\nI need to explore the data to understand what order statuses exist and whether there are any unshipped orders that would constitute \"outgoing inventory.\"",

              "thought": "Let me start by thinking through the TODO items to understand what the user is asking for.\n\n1. **Determine how \"outgoing inventory\" is identified in the data**\n   \"Outgoing inventory\" typically refers to inventory that has been sold/ordered by customers but not yet shipped or fulfilled. Looking at the documentation, I can see:\n   - The `sales_order_header` model has order-level information including `status` field\n   - The `sales_order_detail` model has line-item details for sales orders including `orderqty`\n   - The status field in sales_order_header has codes: 1 In Process, 2 Approved, 3 Backordered, 4 Rejected, 5 Shipped, 6 Cancelled\n   - The documentation notes that the current dataset contains status 5 (Shipped)\n   \n   For \"outgoing inventory,\" I need to identify orders that have been placed but not yet shipped. However, the documentation indicates that the current dataset only contains shipped orders (status = 5). This is a potential issue - if all orders in the system are already shipped, there may be no \"outgoing\" inventory in the traditional sense.\n   \n   Let me think about alternative interpretations:\n   - Orders that are \"In Process\" (status 1), \"Approved\" (status 2), or \"Backordered\" (status 3) would represent outgoing inventory\n   - But the documentation says the dataset contains status 5 (Shipped)\n   \n   I need to validate what statuses actually exist in the data to understand if there are any unshipped orders.\n\n2. **Determine the metric for measuring outgoing inventory**\n   If unshipped orders exist, the metric would be SUM(orderqty) from sales_order_detail joined to sales_order_header where status < 5 (not shipped or cancelled). But I need to verify what data actually exists.\n\n3. **Determine the visualization type and axes**\n   This would be a number card showing the total outgoing inventory quantity, similar to the previous two requests.\n\n4. **Determine if the user is asking for a simple report, more in-depth report, or a dashboard**\n   This is a simple, direct request for a specific metric - a Simple/Direct Request.\n\nI need to explore the data to understand what order statuses exist and whether there are any unshipped orders that would constitute \"outgoing inventory.\"",

All sales orders have status = 5 (Shipped).

        "message": "Let me start by thinking through the TODO items to understand what I need to build for this sales dashboard request.\n\n**1. Determine how \"sales\" is identified**\nLooking at the available data, I can see several sales-related models:\n- `sales_order_header` - contains order-level data with subtotal, taxamt, freight\n- `sales_order_detail` - contains line-level data with linetotal (which is unitprice × orderqty × (1 - unitpricediscount))\n- `total_sales_revenue` - a precomputed metric that calculates total sales revenue by year, quarter, and month\n\nBased on the precomputed_metric_best_practices, I should prioritize using existing precomputed metrics. The `total_sales_revenue` model provides `metric_totalsalesrevenue` which sums line totals from sales order details aggregated by time periods. This is exactly what I need for sales analysis.\n\n**2. Determine the specific time frame for \"last few months\"**\nThe user said \"last few months\" which is somewhat vague. Looking at common patterns, \"last few months\" typically means 3-6 months. I'll default to the last 6 months to provide a good view of recent trends while showing enough data points for meaningful analysis. According to the timeFrame rules, this would be \"Last 6 Months\" for relative date filters.\n\n**3. Determine which metrics beyond sales should be included as \"useful graphics\"**\nFor a comprehensive sales dashboard, I should include:\n- Total sales revenue trend over time (primary metric)\n- Number of orders (to understand volume vs. value)\n- Average order value (to understand basket size)\n- Sales by product category (to show mix)\n- Sales by territory/region (to show geographic performance)\n\nLet me check for precomputed metrics:\n- `total_sales_revenue` - ✓ available\n- `number_of_orders` - ✓ available (metric_numberoforders)\n- `average_order_value` - ✓ available (metric_averageordervalue)\n- `sales_by_product_category` - ✓ available (metric_salesbycategory)\n\nFor territory, I'll need to build from sales_order_header joined to sales_territory.\n\n**4. Determine appropriate dimensions or groupings for sales analysis**\n- Time dimension: Month (for trend analysis over last 6 months)\n- Product category: For understanding product mix\n- Sales territory: For geographic analysis\n\n**5. Determine the visualization type and axes for each chart**\nBased on the visualization guidelines:\n- Sales trend over time: Line chart (time series with month on x-axis, revenue on y-axis)\n- Number of orders trend: Line chart (month on x-axis, order count on y-axis)\n- Average order value trend: Line chart (month on x-axis, AOV on y-axis)\n- Sales by category: Bar chart (category on x-axis, revenue on y-axis)\n- Sales by territory: Bar chart (territory on x-axis, revenue on y-axis)\n\n**6. Determine if any comparisons should be included**\nFor a dashboard showing \"how sales is going,\" I should include current performance context. I could add a summary metric card showing total sales for the period.\n\n**Determining Further Needs**\nI have good clarity on most items. However, I need to:\n1. Verify the date range in the data to ensure \"last 6 months\" will return data\n2. Test the SQL for the territory-based sales metric since it's not precomputed\n3. Confirm the exact column names and structures for the precomputed metrics\n\n**Outlining Remaining Prep Work**\nI need to continue with additional thoughts to:\n- Use executeSql to check the date range of available sales data\n- Test SQL queries for each visualization to ensure they return expected results\n- Validate that the precomputed metrics work as expected for the last 6 months filter",

              "thought": "Let me start by thinking through the TODO items to understand what I need to build for this sales dashboard request.\n\n**1. Determine how \"sales\" is identified**\nLooking at the available data, I can see several sales-related models:\n- `sales_order_header` - contains order-level data with subtotal, taxamt, freight\n- `sales_order_detail` - contains line-level data with linetotal (which is unitprice × orderqty × (1 - unitpricediscount))\n- `total_sales_revenue` - a precomputed metric that calculates total sales revenue by year, quarter, and month\n\nBased on the precomputed_metric_best_practices, I should prioritize using existing precomputed metrics. The `total_sales_revenue` model provides `metric_totalsalesrevenue` which sums line totals from sales order details aggregated by time periods. This is exactly what I need for sales analysis.\n\n**2. Determine the specific time frame for \"last few months\"**\nThe user said \"last few months\" which is somewhat vague. Looking at common patterns, \"last few months\" typically means 3-6 months. I'll default to the last 6 months to provide a good view of recent trends while showing enough data points for meaningful analysis. According to the timeFrame rules, this would be \"Last 6 Months\" for relative date filters.\n\n**3. Determine which metrics beyond sales should be included as \"useful graphics\"**\nFor a comprehensive sales dashboard, I should include:\n- Total sales revenue trend over time (primary metric)\n- Number of orders (to understand volume vs. value)\n- Average order value (to understand basket size)\n- Sales by product category (to show mix)\n- Sales by territory/region (to show geographic performance)\n\nLet me check for precomputed metrics:\n- `total_sales_revenue` - ✓ available\n- `number_of_orders` - ✓ available (metric_numberoforders)\n- `average_order_value` - ✓ available (metric_averageordervalue)\n- `sales_by_product_category` - ✓ available (metric_salesbycategory)\n\nFor territory, I'll need to build from sales_order_header joined to sales_territory.\n\n**4. Determine appropriate dimensions or groupings for sales analysis**\n- Time dimension: Month (for trend analysis over last 6 months)\n- Product category: For understanding product mix\n- Sales territory: For geographic analysis\n\n**5. Determine the visualization type and axes for each chart**\nBased on the visualization guidelines:\n- Sales trend over time: Line chart (time series with month on x-axis, revenue on y-axis)\n- Number of orders trend: Line chart (month on x-axis, order count on y-axis)\n- Average order value trend: Line chart (month on x-axis, AOV on y-axis)\n- Sales by category: Bar chart (category on x-axis, revenue on y-axis)\n- Sales by territory: Bar chart (territory on x-axis, revenue on y-axis)\n\n**6. Determine if any comparisons should be included**\nFor a dashboard showing \"how sales is going,\" I should include current performance context. I could add a summary metric card showing total sales for the period.\n\n**Determining Further Needs**\nI have good clarity on most items. However, I need to:\n1. Verify the date range in the data to ensure \"last 6 months\" will return data\n2. Test the SQL for the territory-based sales metric since it's not precomputed\n3. Confirm the exact column names and structures for the precomputed metrics\n\n**Outlining Remaining Prep Work**\nI need to continue with additional thoughts to:\n- Use executeSql to check the date range of available sales data\n- Test SQL queries for each visualization to ensure they return expected results\n- Validate that the precomputed metrics work as expected for the last 6 months filter",

Since we just confirmed that all sales orders have status = 5 (Shipped), I can use the sales_order_detail data joined with sales_order_header to find shipped quantities. The key is to filter by the shipdate field to get orders shipped in the last month.\n\n2. **Determine how to define \"last month\"**\n   \"Last month\" typically means the trailing 30 days from today, or it could mean the previous calendar month. I'll use the trailing 30 days approach (CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days') as it's more commonly used for \"last month\" in business contexts. I should filter on sales_order_header.shipdate.\n\n3. **Determine the metric for measuring inventory that went out**\n   The metric should be SUM(orderqty) from sales_order_detail joined to sales_order_header where shipdate is within the last 30 days.\n\n4. **Determine the visualization type and axes**\n   Since the user is asking \"how much\" inventory went out, this is asking for a single total value. This should be a number card showing the total quantity shipped in the last month.\n\n5. **Determine if the user is asking for a simple report, more in-depth report, or a dashboard**\n   This is a simple, direct request for a specific metric - a Simple/Direct Request asking for a well-defined metric with a time filter.\n\nI should validate my approach by checking the shipdate data to ensure there are recent shipments and to understand the date range in the data.",

The documentation mentions 'exactly one of personid or storeid is populated per row', suggesting there might be complexity in how customers are represented.

I chose to count all records in the customer table, interpreting 'have' as all customers ever registered in the system.
