This pattern suggests Roger operates as a bike retailer maintaining inventory across various size options to serve different customer needs. The consistent ordering of **HL Mountain Frames** and **ML/HL Mountain Handlebars** (appearing in 6-8 orders) indicates ongoing component purchases, likely for bike assembly, repairs, or customization services.The purchase frequency demonstrates a reliable, repeat-buying pattern with the same core products appearing across multiple orders, making Roger a highly predictable and valuable customer for inventory planning and relationship management.## MethodologyThis analysis identified the top customer using the `customer_all_time_clv.metric_clv_all_time` field, which represents the sum of all `sales_order_detail.linetotal` values across the customer's entire order history. Customer identity was enriched by joining to the `person` table via `customer.personid` to obtain the customer's name.Purchase frequency was calculated by counting distinct `sales_order_header.salesorderid` values for each product purchased by the top customer. This metric represents how many separate orders contained each product, providing insight into which items the customer purchases most consistently over time. Products were identified by joining `sales_order_detail` to `product` on `productid`. Top Customer by Lifetime Value\nIdentifies the customer with the highest all-time lifetime value",
