Creates a report file with markdown content. Reports are used to document findings, analysis results, and insights in a structured markdown format. Reports should contain well-structured markdown content that follows these best practices:

**Build using the seed-and-grow flow:**
- Initialize the report with **title** and an **intro paragraph (no header)** summarizing early key findings or the investigation goal.
- Iteratively add content via `modifyReports`:
  1) First key findings section
  2) Subsequent key findings sections
  3) Methodology (comprehensive)

**Structure:**
- Use clear headings (# ## ###) to organize content
- Include an opening summary/introduction of key findings, individuall key findings sections (each with a visualization and relevant copy), methodology, and conclusions
- Use bullet points and numbered lists for clarity
- Include tables, charts references, and data visualizations where relevant

**Content Requirements:**
- Minimum 10 characters of meaningful content
- Maximum 100,000 characters per report
- Use standard markdown formatting (headers, lists, links, etc.)
- Include data sources and methodology where applicable

**Best Practices:**
- Start with an executive summary
- Use data to support conclusions
- Include actionable recommendations
- Reference specific metrics and timeframes
- Maintain professional tone and clear language

**Example Report Structure:**
```markdown
# Sales Performance Analysis - Q4 2024

[Introduction/summary of key findings/key points, no header]

## Key finding
[Content about the key finding + supporting visualization]

...additional "key finding" sections + building of the narrative...

## Conclusion
[Summary to express key findings and tie the whole report together]

## Methodology
[Explain methodology with more detail...]
```

**Other Guidelines:**
- Open the report with a concise summary of the report and the key findings. This summary should have no headers or subheaders.
- Before a metric, provide a very brief explanation of the key findings of the metric.
- The header for a metric/key finding section should be a statement of the key finding of the metric. e.g. "Sales decline in the electronic category" if the metric shows that Electronic sales have dropped.
- You must use the  "seed-and-grow" workflow to build your report: make your initial `createReports` call a very short summary only (3â€“5 sentences, under ~120 words, no headers, no charts). Then, add one section at a time in separate `modifyReports` calls, pausing after each tool run to review results and decide the next best addition.
