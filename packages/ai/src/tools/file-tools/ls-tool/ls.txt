Lists files and directories in a tree structure for a given path. The path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path. You can control the depth of traversal with the depth parameter (defaults to 3 levels). Directories beyond the depth limit are shown with "... (depth limit)". You can optionally provide an array of glob patterns to ignore with the ignore parameter. You should generally prefer the Glob and Grep tools, if you know which directories to search.
