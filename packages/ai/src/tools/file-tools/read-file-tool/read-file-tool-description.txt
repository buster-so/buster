Reads a file from the local filesystem. You can access any file directly by using this tool.
Assume this tool is able to read all files on the machine. If the User provides a path to a file assume that path is valid. It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned.

Usage:
- The filePath parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path
- By default, it reads up to 1000 lines starting from the beginning of the file
- You can optionally specify an offset and limit for pagination (especially handy for long files):
  - offset: Line number to start reading from (0-indexed, defaults to 0)
  - limit: Maximum number of lines to read (defaults to 1000)
  - Example: { filePath: "/path/file.ts", offset: 100, limit: 100 } reads lines 100-199
- The response includes a "truncated" flag to indicate if more content is available beyond the limit
- Results are returned with line content
- This tool cannot read binary files, including images
- You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively read multiple files as a batch that are potentially useful.
- If you read a file that exists but has empty contents you will receive a system reminder warning in place of file contents.
