/**
 * Analyst Agent Task - Advanced AI-powered data analysis and insights generation
 *
 * This task implements a sophisticated multi-step analysis workflow that:
 * 1. Initializes an analyst agent with proper state management
 * 2. Processes user queries through multiple analysis phases
 * 3. Executes data source discovery and introspection
 * 4. Generates insights, metrics, and dashboards
 * 5. Provides comprehensive analysis results with artifacts
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Multi-modal agent execution with state transitions
 * - Intelligent tool selection based on context
 * - Error recovery and graceful degradation
 * - Real-time progress tracking and streaming
 * - Artifact generation (metrics, dashboards, queries)
 * - Data source integration and validation
 *
 * Workflow States:
 * - Initializing: Setting up agent and validating inputs
 * - Searching: Data catalog search and discovery
 * - Planning: Analysis strategy and execution planning
 * - Analyzing: Core analysis execution with tool usage
 * - Reviewing: Quality assurance and result validation
 * - Completed: Final results and artifact delivery
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const result = await analystAgentTask.trigger({
 *   sessionId: 'session_123',
 *   userId: 'user_456',
 *   query: 'Analyze sales performance by region for Q4',
 *   dataSources: [{
 *     name: 'sales-db',
 *     type: 'postgresql',
 *     credentials: { host: 'localhost', port: 5432, database: 'sales' }
 *   }],
 *   options: {
 *     maxSteps: 15,
 *     enableStreaming: true,
 *     model: 'claude-3-sonnet'
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
